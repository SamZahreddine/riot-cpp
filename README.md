C++ League of Legends API Wrapper by Geoffrey Tucker

riot-cpp is an easy-to-use C++ library with the purpose of handling the HTTP queries and JSON parsing from Riot's API.

This API wrapper depends on both curl and rapidjson libraries. These submodules can be found in the /lib/ folder.

- Rapidjson is a header-only C++ library, but Curl must be compiled and linked on your individual system.
